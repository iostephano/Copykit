# Copykit â€“ Learn to Draw with Apple Pencil

**Copykit**Â is an iOS application designed to help beginner users improve their drawing skills with the Apple Pencil. The app allows users toÂ **trace preloaded images**, making it easier to learn and practice strokes with intuitive tools like pencil, eraser, and color picker.

## Key Features

- **Draw over preloaded images**: Import images from your gallery or use photos taken with the camera.
- **Intuitive drawing tools**: Use pencil, eraser, and customize stroke thickness and opacity.
- **Advanced color picker**: Choose from predefined colors or use a custom color selector.
- **Interface optimized for Apple Pencil**: Supports pressure-sensitive strokes.
- **Save and share your drawings**: Export your work and save it to your gallery.
